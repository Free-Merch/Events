    summary: `
      I attended Blockchain and Business conference, and I must say it was an enlightening experience. One session in particular caught my attention, where I gained a deeper understanding of how blockchain applications can enhance businesses. The speaker emphasized the importance of improving the language and terminology associated with blockchain, especially for local businesses to grasp its potential.

      Another standout session was focused on the Starknet chain. Blessing, the presenter, did a fantastic job unveiling the vast opportunities within the Starknet ecosystem. Their presentation was informative and showcased the immense potential of this technology.
      
      Overall, the conference provided valuable insights into the intersection of blockchain and business. It not only shed light on the practical applications of blockchain, but also highlighted the need for effective communication to bridge the gap between technical jargon and everyday business understanding.
